The environment consists of mountains, a field, forest area and a body of water. All textures on the right of the screenshot were used to paint the terrain. The lighting is deliberately dim to imitate night time.

The cubes are floating, rotating with the center cube having smaller child cubes that float and rotate around the parent cube. The framerate is shown top-right and memory bottom-left.
